# GenLayer Contract Primitives

Two production-ready GenLayer Intelligent Contract primitives that demonstrate
distinct consensus patterns under the **Equivalence Principle**.

Each contract is standalone, documented inline, and paired with an interactive
simulation in the companion web playground.

| Contract | File | Consensus pattern |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AI Web Oracle | [`price_oracle.py`](./price_oracle.py) | Numeric tolerance + partial-field matching |
| Content Moderation | [`content_moderation.py`](./content_moderation.py) | Source-grounded non-comparative validation |

## The Equivalence Principle in one paragraph

GenLayer validators must reach consensus on **non-deterministic** results
(web fetches, LLM outputs). A randomly-selected *leader* executes the
non-deterministic block and publishes a result. Every *validator* independently
re-executes the block (or re-evaluates the leader's output against the same
source) and votes accept or reject. The leader's result is canonicalized into
on-chain state only if a majority agrees. If consensus fails, the network
rotates the leader; if it still fails, the transaction goes **undetermined**
and state is unchanged.

The hard part is the *validator function*: it must verify the substance of the
leader's answer, not just its shape. The three patterns below show how.

## Pattern 1 — Numeric Tolerance + Partial Fields (`price_oracle.py`)

Use when the leader returns structured data with both subjective fields
(reasoning, analysis text) and objective decision fields (prices, scores,
enums), and where the objective fields may drift slightly between runs.

- **Leader**: scrapes a web page, asks the LLM to extract a price and a
  confidence score, returns `{price, currency, confidence, analysis, source_excerpt}`.
- **Validator**: re-runs the same task, then enforces:
  1. `currency` matches exactly,
  2. `price` is within ±2 % of the leader's price,
  3. `confidence` is within ±1 (0–10 scale),
  4. both scores agree if either is the reject sentinel (`0`).
- Subjective `analysis` and `source_excerpt` are stored but never compared —
  two LLMs will always word their reasoning differently.

## Pattern 2 — Source-Grounded Non-Comparative (`content_moderation.py`)

Use when "is this acceptable?" is a judgment call that should be evaluated
against explicit, written criteria — not by independently generating a second
opinion and comparing.

- **Leader**: pulls the submitted post, asks the LLM to classify it against the
  community guidelines, returns `{verdict, severity, violated_rules, rationale}`.
- **Validator**: re-fetches the same content, then uses the
  `EqNonComparativeValidator` template to judge whether the leader's verdict
  is *defensible* given the source and the criteria. The validator does **not**
  produce its own verdict — it grades the leader's.
- This is the right pattern for moderation, code review, and any task where
  multiple defensible answers exist but only one needs to be picked.

## Why these two together

| Axis | Oracle | Moderation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Validator generates own answer? | Yes | No |
| Comparison mechanism | Programmatic (numeric) | LLM judges leader vs criteria |
| Subjective fields | Stored, not compared | Stored, not compared |
| On-chain side effects | Update price table | Apply moderation action + reputation |

Together they cover two of the places real GenLayer apps end up: feeding the
chain with external data, and gating user-generated content.

## Running the contracts

Deploy any of these in the [GenLayer Studio](https://studio.genlayer.com/),
or via the [GenLayer CLI](https://docs.genlayer.com/developers/genlayer-js)
against a localnet:

```bash
genlayer deploy contracts/price_oracle.py \
  --args '["BTC-USD", "https://api.example.com/prices/BTC-USD"]'
```

See [`tests/`](./tests) for the equivalence-principle test sketches that
exercise the leader/validator branches in isolation.

### Content moderation authorization

`submit(post_id, content_url)` binds the author to `gl.message.sender_address`.
There is no `author` parameter — an account can only submit its own content,
so nobody can push reputation-affecting posts on behalf of a third party.
Each `post_id` is write-once; an accepted verdict cannot be silently
overwritten by a later call.
